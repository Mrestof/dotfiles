# Allows to skip ads in a very easy way if two prerequisites are present:
#   1. This command is bound to a key combination.
#   2. Spotify is configured to launch on background.
# For example on Sway WM one would add the following in his configs:
#   `assign [instance="spotify"] workspace =`
#   `bindsym --locked $mod+shift+p exec restart-spotify`

killall -KILL spotify
spotify-launcher
sleep 0.5
playerctl play
